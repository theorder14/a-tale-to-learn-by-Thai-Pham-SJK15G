The Demon King prepared to attack with his hammer but all of the sudden, he slipped and the hammer accidently hit his vurnable spot and knocked him unconscious.

Niclas the warrior saw his opportunity, he grabbed the Demon Kings hammer and with it his power and knocked Hannes unconscious. 
The danish children carried Hannes and Xedric back to town, where Denmark would be unthankfully remebered as traitors! 
They made Niclas king and worshiped him, since Hannes was passed out and the danish children cast away for treasury against their captor, Kony.
