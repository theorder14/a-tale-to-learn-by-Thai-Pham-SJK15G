It's up to the warrior Niclas and the mage Hannes to save the world.

Niclas sidekick besides Hannes is the very air he is breathing, but he asthma so
sometimes his sidekick let him down. Niclas also has very weak legs, chicken-ish legs you know,
kinda like them you see on people who doesnt have a "leg-gym-day" on their weekly schedule.
