For years now, people in the village of Webhalla had had their computers infected with a trojan virus known as the Black Plague, wich 
renders the users screen black. It infects other computers at close proximity through wi-fi and bluetooth, a malicious virus indeed. 
Not even the great Highland clan of McAfee could help the village. The villagers pleaded to the hero(es) to help them slay the
Demon King, for they were growing tires and restless without their gaming gear.
