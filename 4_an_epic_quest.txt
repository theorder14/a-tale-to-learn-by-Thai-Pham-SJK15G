For years now, people in the village of Webhalla had had their computers infected with a trojan virus known as the Black Plague, whhich 
renders the users screen black. It infects other computers at close proximity through wi-fi and bluetooth, a malicious virus indeed. 
Not even the great Highland clan of McAfee could help the village. The villagers pleaded to the hero(es) to help them slay the
Demon King, for they were growing tires and restless without their gaming gear. 

Niclas and the mage Hannes thought that this (problem) could be their ultimate quest that they had been looking for, for ages.
But they did not know where to start or what to wear on this mighty quest. Niclas liked dresses alot, but was ashamed of this
faschonista of his and Hannes wanted to be naked for some reason.
